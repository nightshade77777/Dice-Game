# dice-game
 The players roll two 6-sided dice each and get points depending on what they roll. 
 There are 5 rounds in a game. In each round, each player rolls the two dice. 
 
 The rules are: 
 • The points rolled on each player’s dice are added to their score. 
 
 • If the total is an even number, an additional 10 points are added to their score. 
 
 • If the total is an odd number, 5 points are subtracted from their score. 
 
 • If they roll a double, they get to roll one extra die and get the number of points rolled added to their score. 
 
 • The score of a player cannot go below 0 at any point. 
 
 • The person with the highest score at the end of the 5 rounds wins. 
 
 • If both players have the same score at the end of the 5 rounds, they each roll 1 die and whoever gets the highest score wins (this repeats until someone wins).
